# Gateways.NET

Sample ASP.NET Core 3.1 WEB API with SDK for use from .NET proyects

The solution includes:
1- ASP.NET Core 3.1 WEB API (Gateways.NET)
2- A Common resources library (Gateways.NET.Core)
3- A simple SDK project for easily use the API from .NET projects (Gateways.NET.SDK)
4- A general Unit Tests Project (Gateways.NET.Tests)

The main API relies on a SQL Server database. To create and update the database follow the commands instructions included on the "db migrations commands" text file on the Documentation folder, or manually create and empty database and run the script migrations.sql included on the Migrations\sql folder of the main API project.

The Swagger documentation ([base URL]/index.html) generated by the main WEB API includes a basic UI that can be used to manually test the features (try it out). Adittionally, on the Documentation folder it's included a Postman collection with sample models.
